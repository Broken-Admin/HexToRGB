# Hex to RGB
- ./hexToRGB.js is the main module which exports a single function.
- ./tests/ contains 2 tests, for both 6 and 3 digit color codes.
- Hex codes are to be input to the function as strings, such as `'FFFFFF'`.
- The code is case insensitive and `'FFFFFF'` and `'ffffff'` return the same.

`This was purely a proof-of-concept made out of boredom over the time of 2 or so days.`
